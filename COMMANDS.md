# L4B2 commands
The L4B commands can be sent via chat or via console.

If via console, the command must be prefixed with the `l4b` trigger.

Example:
```
scripted_user_func l4b,bots,lead
```

If via chat, the prefix is `!l4b`, but you can also omit the prefix entirely.

Example:
```
!l4b nick heal
nick heal
```


### Order commands

### Cancelling orders
To cancel all or some of the order use: <_botsource_> **cancel** [_switch_]

<_botsource_> can be:
- bots (all the bots)
- botname (name of the bot)

***"bot" botsource is not allowed here.***

[_switch_] is optional and can be:
| Switch | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| _current_ | The given bot(s) will abort his/their current order and will proceed with the next one in the queue (if any) |
| _ordertype_ | The given bot(s) will abort all his/their orders (current and queued ones) of type _ordertype_<br />Example: `coach cancel lead` |
| _orders_ | The given bot(s) will abort all his/their orders (current and queued ones) of any type |
| _defib_ | The given bot(s) will abort any pending defib task.<br />"botname cancel defib" is temporary (the bot will retry).<br />"bots cancel defib" is permanent (currently dead survivors will be abandoned) |
| _all_ (or empty) | The given bot(s) will abort everything (orders, current pick-up, anything) |


### Don't remember a command?
From the game just type:
```
!l4b help
```

to see the list of the allowed commands and:
```
!l4b help <command>
```

For the info on that command.


### Orders queue
The orders that are added to the bot's queue are automatically executed according to their priorities:
| Order | Priority |
| :-- | :-- |
carry | 0 |
follow | 0 |
lead | 0 |
scavenge | 0 |
goto | 1 |
wait | 1 |
deploy | 2 |
heal | 2 |
use | 2 |
destroy | 2 |
witch | 3 |

Orders with higher priority are executed first.

Orders with the same priority are executed with the same order as they have been received.

The next order in the queue is not executed until the current order is finished or cancelled (Example: `coach cancel current`).


### Bot selection (for commands via vocalizer)
To select the bot for the command via vocalizer you can look at the bot and use the **"Look"** vocalizer line (like in L4B1). However that vocalizer line is very inconsistent, sometimes your character fails to call the bot and will say **"Weapons here"** or something else, depending on what is in your field of view.

So i added a command to simplify this process: **botselect** [_botname_]

_botname_ is the name of the bot you want to select. If you omit it, the addon will automatically select the bot closest to your crosshair.

The `!l4b` trigger is mandatory if you use this command via chat but you may want to use the console version instead and bind it to some key on the keyboard:
```
bind "KEY" "scripted_user_func l4b,botselect"
```


### Default vocalizer bindings
| Vocalizer line | Vocalizer command | L4B2 command 1 | L4B2 command 2 |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
Lead | PlayerLeadOn | bots lead | botname lead |
Wait | PlayerWaitHere | bots wait | botname wait |
GO | PlayerEmphaticGo | bots goto | botname goto |
Witch | PlayerWarnWitch | bot witch | botname witch |
Move | PlayerMoveOn | bot use | botname use |
Stay Together | PlayerStayTogether | bots cancel | botname cancel |
Follow me | PlayerFollowMe | bot follow me | botname follow me |
Suggest Heal | iMT_PlayerSuggestHealth | bots heal | botname heal |
Ask health | AskForHealth2 | bot heal me | botname heal me |
I'm here! | PlayerAnswerLostCall | bot give | botname give |
Hello | iMT_PlayerHello | bot swap | botname swap |
Hurry | PlayerHurryUp | bots hurry | botname hurry |
I'm with you | PlayerImWithYou | bots automation all | botname automation all |


You can change these bindings by editing the file `ems/left4bots2/cfg/vocalizer.txt`.

Each line in the file is in the format: <_vocalizer command_> = <_l4b2 command1_>,<_l4b2 command2_>

<_l4b2 command1_> and <_l4b2 command2_> must be the complete commands as you type them in chat (without the `!l4b` trigger).

<_l4b2 command1_> is the command that will be used when no bot is selected.

<_l4b2 command2_> is for the command after selecting the bot. Here you can use the keyword `botname` which will be replaced by the name of the selected bot.


### Change L4B2 settings on-the-fly
As Admin you can inspect/change any L4B2 setting directly from the game via `settings` command:
```
!l4b settings dodge_spit
!l4b settings dodge_spit 0
```


If you don't remember the correct name of the settings you can use the `findsettings` command to list all the setting names matching the given text:
```
!l4b findsettings dodge
```


### Reload weapon preference files
Preference files in the `weapons` cfg folder are reloaded at the beginning of each round but as admin you can force a reload with the `reloadweapons` command for one specific bot or all of them:
```
!l4b reloadweapons coach
!l4b reloadweapons all
```
